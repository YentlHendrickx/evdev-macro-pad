# evdev macro pad
Learning more about Linux event management and input system. For now basic 'physical camera zoom with volume scroll wheel' is "implemented" using v4l2-ctl. In the future; I plan to design a custom macro pad to fit into my PC setup, and use it to control both music and camera settings.

More to come eventually... I hope...
